                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Tithi is a lunar day in the Hindu calendar, based on the angular relationship between the Sun and Moon. Unlike the solar calendar (Gregorian calendar) where a day is exactly 24 hours, a Tithi can vary from 19 to 26 hours. There are 30 Tithis in a lunar month - 15 in Shukla Paksha (waxing phase) and 15 in Krishna Paksha (waning phase). Tithis are crucial for determining festival dates and auspicious timings in Telugu culture.</p>

                            <p>Nakshatra refers to the 27 lunar constellations or star groups in Vedic astrology. Each Nakshatra has unique characteristics and influences. The Moon passes through each Nakshatra as it orbits Earth, spending approximately one day in each. Nakshatras are essential for birth chart analysis, determining compatibility for marriages, selecting Muhurtams for important events, and understanding daily cosmic influences on activities and decisions.</p>

                            <p>Yoga in Panchangam refers to one of the 27 divisions of time calculated based on the combined motion of the Sun and Moon. Each Yoga has specific characteristics that influence the auspiciousness of activities. Some Yogas like Siddha, Sadhya, and Shubha are considered highly favorable, while others like Vyatipata and Vaidhriti are generally avoided for important activities.</p>

                            <p>Karana is half of a Tithi (lunar day). Since there are 30 Tithis in a lunar month, there are 60 Karanas. There are 11 types of Karanas: 4 fixed Karanas (Shakuni, Chatushpada, Naga, and Kimstughna) and 7 movable Karanas (Bava, Balava, Kaulava, Taitila, Garaja, Vanija, and Vishti/Bhadra). Karana influences the auspiciousness of activities during different parts of the day.</p>

There are two Pakshas in each lunar month: Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight or waxing moon) and Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight or waning moon). Each Paksha consists of 15 Tithis. Shukla Paksha generally considered more auspicious for new beginnings, while Krishna Paksha is suitable for completion of tasks and spiritual practices.</p>

This time is believed to be free from all doshas (flaws) and is excellent for starting new ventures, important meetings, travel, and auspicious activities. Unlike other Muhurtams, Abhijit doesn't require extensive Panchangam consultation and is universally favorable.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Amavasya (New Moon) and Pournami (Full Moon) are highly significant in Telugu and Hindu culture. Amavasya is ideal for performing Pitru Tarpana (rituals for ancestors), meditation, and introspection. It's considered important for spiritual practices. Pournami is auspicious for prayers, fasting (especially for Lord Satyanarayan), and performing pujas. Many Telugu festivals are celebrated on Pournami days, including Guru Pournami and Kartika Pournami.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Muhurtam is an auspicious time period selected based on Panchangam calculations for performing important activities and ceremonies. The selection considers Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana, day of the week, and planetary positions to identify the most favorable time for specific activities like marriages, housewarming, vehicle purchase, naming ceremonies, etc.</p>

                            <p>Yes, our Telugu Calendar provides essential Panchangam information that can help in planning auspicious occasions.

Our calendar serves as an excellent reference for general auspicious timings and festival dates.</p>

                            <p>Lahiri Ayanamsa is the most widely used ayanamsa (precession correction) system in Indian Vedic astrology. It accounts for the precession of equinoxes to calculate accurate positions of zodiac signs and Nakshatras. The Lahiri Ayanamsa is officially recognized by the Government of India and is used in our Panchangam calculations.</p>

                            <p>Variations in Panchangam timings can occur due to different calculation methods, ayanamsa systems, or location coordinates used. We use the Lahiri Ayanamsa with Swiss Ephemeris for maximum accuracy. Small differences (usually a few minutes) are normal and don't significantly impact the practical use of Panchangam.</p>
